## Tone Generator

This program has two parts.
First, it has the command line version, called generator.
Second, it has the gui version, called Gui.tcl.

Generator is called with the form
generator freq [duration]

- freq is the frequency of the tone in Hz.
- duration is the duration the tone will play in milli seconds.

If duration isn't given, it is assumed to be 1000 milli seconds.

The gui is just two text boxes that fill in this data and call generator.
