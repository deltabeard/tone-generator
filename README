# Tone Generator

This program has two parts.
First, it has the command line version, called generator. Depends on sdl1.2
Second, it has the GUI version, called Gui.tcl. Additionally depends on tclsh.

Generator is called with the form:
generator freq [duration]

- freq is the frequency of the tone in Hz.
- duration is the duration the tone will play in milliseconds.

If duration isn't given, it is assumed to be 1000 milliseconds.

The GUI is just two text boxes that fill in this data and call generator.

## Installation
```
$ brew install sdl
$ git clone https://github.com/sziep/tone-generator.git
$ cd tone-generator && make
$ ./generator 2000 700
```
